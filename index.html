        Saving up $1,000 is quite an accomplishment — don’t let anyone tell you
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        But declaring victory and letting that money just sit in your savings
        account won’t do you any favors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average annual percentage yield (APY) for a normal savings account
        is just 0.06%, according to the FDIC. That means if you leave your
        $1,000 untouched, it’ll only earn $0.60 in interest over the course of a
        year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t let your money stagnate. Here are a few things you can do to make
        that money work for you, plus a few tips on helping you save for your
        next $1,000.
      </p>
      <h3>Add a little color to your investment portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Most people have never even considered investing in art. Masterpieces by
        Warhol, Monet and Banksy might be ballooning in value, but they cost
        tens of millions — and you’ve got $1,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things have changed. Even if you just have $20 to start, you’re able to
        invest in fine artwork from some of the greatest creators of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Masterworks</a> is the first company that gives you access
        to shares of artwork, just like owning shares in a company. It lets you
        bypass the hard parts of art collecting, so you can just enjoy the
        rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 1995 and 2020, contemporary art outperformed the S&P 500 by 174%
        — that’s nearly three times the returns — according to the Citi Global
        Art Market chart.

      <h3>Stop overpaying for car insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Saving your next $1,000 will be a lot easier than the first if you stop
        throwing money away on overpriced insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to set and forget these kinds of bills, but experts say you
        need to shop around every six months to ensure you're still getting the
        best deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">SmartFinancial</a> can help you find a lower rate on your
        current coverage in minutes.

        driving record, and SmartFinancial will instantly sort through more than
        200 insurance companies to find you lower prices in your area.
      </p>

        When was the last time you asked yourself what your debit card was doing
        for you? Traditional banks rarely offer you incentives to use your card
        — in fact, it’s more likely they’re dinging you with hidden fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="#">Aspiration</a>, you get to choose how much you want to
        pay, even if that’s $0 a month. And if you need an extra service like a
        wire transfer, they will only charge you what it costs them to provide
        and not a penny more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aspiration has so much trust in its members that it will even send you
        your paycheck up to two days early.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, depending on how much you want to pay for your account, Aspiration
        will give you 0.5%, 3%, 5%, even 10% cash back on purchases at
        sustainable businesses. That’s extra money you’re getting just by using
        Aspiration for all kinds of everyday purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to do to power up your debit card is sign up with your
        email and link your banking info to your new, free Aspiration account.

      <h3>Start investing with as little as $5</h3>
      <p>
        The first lesson many of us learn about money is that spare change adds
        up. But how can you take advantage of that when few people are using
        cash these days?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you do most of your shopping online or with a card, you can make
        better use of your digital dimes and nickels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Acorns</a> is an investing service and savings tool rolled
        into one. When you make a purchase on your credit or debit card, Acorns
        automatically rounds up the price to the nearest dollar and places the
        excess — the coins that would wind up in your pocket if you were paying
        cash — into a smart investment portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signing up for Acorns takes less than five minutes, and you can start
        saving automatically for just $3 a month. Plus, if you sign up with our
        special link, Acorns will add $10 to your account as soon as you make
        your first investment.
